# D&amp;D Combat Encounter Difficulty
This is a UWP desktop application created with the purpose of computing the encounter difficulty for D&amp;D 5e.

It offers a wide range of monsters from which you can make your choices, as well as the options of selecting the party members level and number. As soon as a monster is added to the Encounter Info list, or when a change is made in the party, the difficulty of the encounter and the experience gained from it will be updated (the adjusted experience required for a precise computing is also updated). The rules for doing this computation were taken from the [official source](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/building-combat-encounters).

The last state of the application is saved, therefore the application starts with the last active encounter and party formation.

The monster information is taken from [D&amp;D 5e API](https://www.dnd5eapi.co), so an internet connection is always required for the application to work.
